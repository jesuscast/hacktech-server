Login into any website using only your fingeprint. Biometrics are not a field of only the goverment and academics anymore. In recent years, advancements of technology have enable mass use of powerful sensors such as synaptics fingerprint sensor. Now we need to exploit this power by creating the next generation of services. Our product's security relies in industry standard encryption algorithms and best practices. Our fingerprint matching technology is built on top of open source code developed by the United States Goverments Federal Agency. Although we do not own the intellectual property of many of those algorithms - since they are widely academically known -, our integration with advanced web technologies can lead a potential standard..

Inspiration
=======
Jesus Castaneda always wanted to use fingerprint sensors. During a hackathon at Pasadena some sensors were available and this project was born. Although this project was done in a rush we hope to improve the security of the system, by streaming the data directly from the device to the network without physical storage in between, by using better encryption techniques, and by providing an API for websites to integrate.
